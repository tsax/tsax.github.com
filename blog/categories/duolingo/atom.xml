    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been playing with <a href="http://www.duolingo.com">Duolingo</a> for around a month, specifically with the Spanish module. It's absolutely fantastic. I'd signed up for an invitation back in the day as I tend to sign up for any new startups or services I think may be cool to try out. I had as much interest in learning Spanish at this time as I do in learning to bake, which is in the category of 'it'd be nice but i have other things to do.' Since trying it out, I've been totally hooked! The feeling engendered by the act of proper recollection is deeply satisfying. I can't say I recall much of anything I learned in French or Arabic classes back in school and I did those for 2 and 3 yrs respectively. But I was able to recall words, sentences and even basic verb conjugations just two days after starting Duolingo.</p>

<p>So, if you have any interest at all in learning Spanish, French, Italian, German or Portuguese (these are the available modules currently), click over to <a href="http://www.duolingo.com">Duolingo</a>, you'll thank me later.</p>

<p>Oh, did I mention it's absolutely free?</p>
