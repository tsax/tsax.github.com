    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been playing with <a href="http://www.duolingo.com">Duolingo</a> for around a month, specifically with the Spanish module. It&#8217;s absolutely fantastic. I&#8217;d signed up for an invitation back in the day as I tend to sign up for any new startups or services I think may be cool to try out. I had as much interest in learning Spanish at this time as I do in learning to bake, which is in the category of &#8216;it&#8217;d be nice but i have other things to do.&#8217; Since trying it out, I&#8217;ve been totally hooked! The feeling engendered by the act of proper recollection is deeply satisfying. I can&#8217;t say I recall much of anything I learned in French or Arabic classes back in school and I did those for 2 and 3 yrs respectively. But I was able to recall words, sentences and even basic verb conjugations just two days after starting Duolingo.</p>

<p>So, if you have any interest at all in learning Spanish, French, Italian, German or Portuguese (these are the available modules currently), click over to <a href="http://www.duolingo.com">Duolingo</a>, you&#8217;ll thank me later.</p>

<p>Oh, did I mention it&#8217;s absolutely free?</p>

    <id>http://www.tusharsaxena.com/blog/2013/02/15/pow-environment-variable-trouble</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was caught up in excitement upon discovering <a href="http://pow.cx">pow</a>. After setting it up, and testing it out on the project I&#8217;m working on now, I encountered a problem. My app is setup to send email using Gmail thru SMTP configured in a Rails environment config, and the email is sent using ActionMailer.</p>

<p>The config looks like this</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>address: "smtp.gmail.com",
</span><span class='line'>port: 587,
</span><span class='line'>user_name: ENV["GMAIL_USERNAME"],
</span><span class='line'>password: ENV["GMAIL_PASSWORD"],
</span><span class='line'>authentication: :login
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>  The emails were arriving when I tested the app by running <code>rails server</code> but on the local pow server, authentication errors were the norm. Clearly the environment variables weren&#8217;t being set. So I googled pow&#8217;s documentation for how to setup environment variables, ending up on <a href="http://pow.cx/manual.html#section_2.2">this page</a>. While reading through the linked section, I missed something critical.</p>

<p>  &#8220;Pow attempts to execute two scripts — first .powrc, then .powenv — <strong>in the application&#8217;s root</strong>. Any environment variables exported from these scripts are passed along to Rack.&#8221;</p>

<p>  So I idiotically set about creating a .powrc file in my user/bin directory. Obviously this did not work, but I wasted an hour or so tweaking random settings trying to get this to work. Then I re-read the page, set about to fix the problem, which I did as follows.</p>

<ol>
<li>Run <code>touch .powrc</code> in my project&#8217;s root.</li>
<li>Edit .powrc and add the environment variables as follows:
<code>
export GMAIL_USERNAME=username
export GMAIL_PASSWORD="my password"
</code></li>
<li>Restart pow&#8217;s worker for the app by running
<code>touch tmp/restart.txt</code></li>
</ol>


<p>  And that worked!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3191-announcing-pow-040-with-xipio-support">Pow is awesome</a></p>

<p><img src="http://mahoutofu.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/pow.jpg" width="250" height="250"></p>

<p>I understood the obsessive focus of talented hackers on customizing and shortening every part of the development workflow, including reducing one word (5 letter) commands to 2 letter commands, in an intellectual manner, but I hadn&#8217;t <em>felt</em> it, till I started experimenting with Rails development. Typing <code>rails s</code> every minute can get old. This is where <a href="http://pow.cx/">pow</a> along with <a href="https://github.com/Rodreegez/powder">powder</a> have been awesome. Now when I create a new rails app, I just run
<code>powder link</code> to create a pow dev server for my app. Now, whenever I feel like testing out my app in the browser, I just launch <code>powder open</code> and the app is served in the browser. This replaces launching the rails server, followed by switching to the server and navigating to localhost:3000.</p>

<p>So, I want to end by thanking the 37Signals dev team, along with Adam Rogers and Phil Nash for making my life easier.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From the Enlightenment onwards, we humans have betrayed a supreme confidence in our ability to read, interpret, deconstruct and ultimately triumph over the natural world using nothing but our faculties of reason, through their manifestations in science, technology and philosophy.</p>

<p>Okay that sounded way too high-brow. Nonetheless, I just came across <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2012/4/9/why-my-slime-mold-is-better-than-your-hadoop-cluster.html">this awe-inspiring post</a> at High Scalability.</p>

<p>A creature as &#8216;simple&#8217; as a slime mold is capable of amazing feats of computation by following simple rules that Nature has granted it through evolution. I don&#8217;t know whether scientists have deconstructed slime molds down to individual proteins and built up a whole model of it, though that seems unlikely and complex. And that&#8217;s the point! The organization and structure of a slime mold, though simple compared to multi-cellular organisms like us, is still extremely complex for our minds to deconstruct through observation and reason. There&#8217;s logic embedded in the structural complexity of the natural world not wholly visible to us.</p>

<p>Since I haven&#8217;t yet tried &#8216;genetic programming,&#8217; I don&#8217;t know how effective it is in adopting nature&#8217;s solutions to some computation problems, nonetheless I should give it a shot sometime, perhaps using <a href="http://hackershelf.com/book/5/clever-algorithms/">this book on HackerShelf</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Going through Zed Shaw&#8217;s <a href="http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/">Learn Ruby the Hard Way</a>, I now recognize the importance of typing in the context of learning to program a new language. My professional experience in software development consisted of .NET development in C#, which is extremely similar to JAVA in syntax. So, upon encountering Ruby syntax elements such as pipes &#8216;|&#8217;, typing the code becomes slow due to a lack of practice, which impedes and constricts thinking.</p>

<p>Typing code like the excerpt above has developed muscle memory for me, and made me think of solutions faster, just as Zed said it would.</p>

<p>Happy typing!</p>
